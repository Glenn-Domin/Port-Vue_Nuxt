    <h2>About Me.</h2>
    <p>I've been a Front-End Developer (and Joomla Developer, and WordPress Developer) doing work for agencies for roughly five years. Prior to that I've done freelance work, as well as creating websites for businesses I've worked at in other capacities.</p>
    <p>I've attempted to be a bit of an all-rounder, gaining exposure in as many facets of web development as I can, as well as dipping my toe in to design/UX/UI. Having said that, I've also managed to specialise in a few key areas:</p>
    <ul>
      <li>Standards-compliant Front-End Development (Bootstrap, SASS, GitHub, etc)</li>
      <li>Joomla/WordPress site development</li>
      <li>HTML EDM template creation</li>
      <li>Tricky CSS problems and advanced CSS concepts</li>
      <li>Site Optimisation</li>
    </ul>
